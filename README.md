# UploadSharp
A mobile app that runs on Xamarin.Android and C#! It can upload either an image or images. To your computer remotely, assuming you have an API that is already pre-made.

# How it works
When you choose either an image or multiple images to send over to the server. A PUT request will be sent, the api then resizes it. The repository for web api can be found [here](https://github.com/YJH16120/Web-API)

### No it's not a new nuget package
